# Classes

- Almost same as struct but with difference in access types
- Struct is public by default
- Classes are private by default
- syntax `class BankAccount {class body};`
- if the access is not specified then it is private by default


- constructors and destructors are function members
	- Classes
		- Create diverse constructors
		- allocate memory
		- overload operators
		- context aware conversion

- Constructors
	- with no arguments - default
	- with an argument as the object of the same class - copy constructor
		- called so because it creates a copy of the object in the argument.
	- with arguments - custom constructor
