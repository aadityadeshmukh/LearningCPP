# STL containers

- Vectors
	- Sequence container
	- Holds objects in strict sequential order
	- include the `<vector>` header
	- initialized using standard template syntax `<>` will hold type
	- initializer list - C++11 and later
	- methods:
		- `size`
		- `front`
		- `back`
		- `[]`
		- `.at()`
		- `insert` - we pass a begin iterator 
		- `erase`
		- `push_back`
		- `pop_back`
		- `empty`
		- `clear`
		- constructor
		- copy constructor
		- move constructor - move all elements from vector 4 to 5
		- optimized for random access
- List
	- sequence container like vector
	- optimized for rapid insert and delete operations
	- do not support random access
	- fast & lean
- Pair and Tuple
	- pair 
		- `utility` header
		- `pair<type 1, type 2>`
	- tuple
		- `tuple` header
		- container with multiple value  type stored together 
- Array
	- fixed size sequence container
	- c++11
	- 
- Deque
	- double ended queue
	- has semantics of a vector
	- optimized for rapid push and pop
	- `push_back`
	- `pop_back`
	- `push_front`
	- `pop_front`
	- default container for stacks and queue
- Queue
	- pushed from back
	- popped from front
	- adapter container that adapts an underline container into a FIFO queue
- Stack
	- LIFO queue
	- adapter container
- Set
	- holds a sorted set of elements
	- multi set allows duplicates
	- set does not
	- unordered_set will not sort
		- it will have an undefined order based on hashes
		- search is quicker
- Maps
	- sorted list of key value pairs like an associative array
	- elements in a map is a pair
	- key - value pair
	- access
		- ["key"]
		- at("key")
		- find("key")
