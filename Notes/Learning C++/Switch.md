# Switch

- syntax `switch(<test condition>)`
	- `case 1:`
	- `case 2:` ...etc

- you can only check for `==`
- no other conditional checks apply
- once the valid condition is reached the compiler looks for a `break;` statement
- else it will run all the cases after the positive one
- `default` case is a catch all case
