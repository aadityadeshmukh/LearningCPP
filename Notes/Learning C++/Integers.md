# Integers & Integer sizes


- `char`
	- Yes char is an integer type
	- Can have various sizes but is mostly equal to 1 byte
- `short int`
	- 2 byte
- `int`
	- 4 bytes
- `long int`
	- 4 to 8 bytes
- `long long int`
	- 8 bytes

- signed integers reserve a bit for the "sign"
- unsigned do not do this
- but both have same sizes

- use `sizeof(variable)` to check size of any data type
