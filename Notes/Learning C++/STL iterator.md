- An iterator is an STL object that can iterate through a container
- Acts a lot like a pointer	
	- can be dereferenced
	- can be incremented
- iterator class is defined in the scope of the container class
- bound to the type of the container
- auto works and is preferred
- Types:
	- input
		- used for reading activities
		- it can
			- read not write
			- increment but not decrement
			- once a value is read it cannot be read again
			- example: `istream_iterator`
			- defined in `iterator` header
	- output
		- !input iterator
		- constucted with a separator
		- 
	- Forward
		- combination of a input and output iterator
		- `forward_list` is a single linked list type
			- designed to iterate from beginning to end but not the reversse
			- range based for loop uses a forward iterator
	- Bidirectional
		- Forward iterator + it can iterate from back to front
	- Random Access
		- used to access any element at any position in a container
		- provides all the functionality of a C-pointer
