# Algorithms and Pseudocode

- C++ is a OOP language but still reads in sequential manner
- HTML / GUI Programming rely on event for execution
- C++ / Java are compiled and run


- To write a program we need a plan of what needs to be done
	- can be written in plain english
	- or a flowchart


- Variables
	- Variables are temporary space in computer memory to hold data
	- they can be dynamic or mutable or constant
	- Assignment flow
		- The data is moved from right to left
		- everything on the right is done first
	- Variables cannot be equations. 
		- This is because if the value of the variables change after the assignment happens then they are not updated.
