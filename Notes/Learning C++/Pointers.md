# Pointers

- Arrays need the number of elements to be defined at declaration
- syntax `datatype * var1;`
- pointer is basically an address of a memory location
- assignment `var1 = &v1` 
	- var 1 will start referencing the same address as v1
	- if you change the value stored in var1 by `*var1 = 33` then v1 will also have that value
