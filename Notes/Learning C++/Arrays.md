# Arrays

- declaration syntax `<data-type> <variable-name> [<size>]`
	- Can add values at declaration time like `int matrix[3] = {1,2,3}`
	- Or can add index by index like `matrix[2] = 2`
	- Arrays can be multidimensional
- Metaphor: Apartment complex
	- Everyone has the same address "123 sunset boulevard"
	- But everyone stays at an indexed location
	- Example: 123 sunset boulevard apartment 3
